* The task Create a game around a predefined theme in 48 hours.
---------------------------------------------------------------


* The goal Get some game development experience under my belt.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Two weeks ago I participated in my first game jam. For those who don't
know what a game jam is, it's a social gathering of individuals that
want to make games making games. You get a set time limit, normally 48
hours and normally takes place over a weekend to complete. There are no
prizes, no winners, but guaranteed to be a few games and some fun times.

Here are my thoughts on my very first game jame.

1. Meet as many people as you can.
   
   I can't stress this enough. You'll most likely not know anyone going
into the jam and even if you do, I'd suggest you go forth and meet other
people. Part of the jam is to be social and meet others. You won't do
that if you stay with your group of friends.

2. Try getting people that complement your skills.

   So, if you're a programmer, get an artist and/or sound designer. If
you're an artist, reach out to a programmer. If you have the rare skills
of having it all, then pick your weakest skill and concentrate on
leveling that up while finding someone to fill in your gaps. It's a
learning experience, so it's your shot to do something you normally
don't do. Give yourself a challenge.

3. Come prepared.

   I made the mistake of not even looking at a few game dev frameworks,
like [Flixel](http://flixel.org/) or [XNA](http://create.msdn.com/), 
or the drag and drop GUIs or [GameMaker](http://www.yoyogames.com/make), [Construct 2](http://www.scirra.com/construct2) or [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/), so I
stayed up the first night and learned the basics of Flixel.

4. Use what you know.

   In contrast to point 2, if you are just getting into programming,
such as someone like myself, stick with what you know for your first
game jam. I made the mistake of throwing away my prototype game I made
in Flixel to work in Unity3D because I thought it'd be easier for the
people in our group as whole to understand. Flixel is a bunch of code,
there's nothing to drag and drop, but it accounts for many things you'd
do while making a game. Because I decided to switch, I spent much of
Saturday learning how Unity3D works and didn't contribute as much as I
had hoped to the project.

5. Stick with a small group of people.

   The first day, we started off with 6 people, which ballooned into 8/9
people. The end result was, some people didn't get their work into the
game. There are no prizes and it's not a competition, so I felt really
bad for the members in my group that didn't get to contribute their
stuff. If I worked with 1 or 2 others, I think it would've been a better
experience.

6. Don't be afraid to throw things away.

   If you don't feel like something's working, toss it and try something
else. You only have 48 hours, so if it's not working, don't be afraid to
throw it away. We threw away our initial idea after the first 2 hours of
brainstorming and came up with something completely different.

7. Get your game in a working state as quickly as possible.

   You'll want to playtest as early as you can to make sure your game is
fun. If you're not having fun or other people aren't, then something's
not working and you'll need to change it up.

8. Use some type of filesharing mechanism.

   Whether it be [github](https://github.com/) or [dropbox](http://dropbox.com/), definitely use something that people
can use to easily share files back and forth.

9. Lastly, have fun!

   You're giving away your entire weekend, so have some fun, meet new
people, learn something new, and play some awesome games.
